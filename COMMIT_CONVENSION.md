# Git Commit Message Convention

To keep our Git history consistent, readable, and easy to work with, we follow the [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.

## ðŸ“Œ Commit Format
```
<type>(optional scope): short summary

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```


### Example:
```
feat(profile): add avatar upload form
```

This introduces a new profile section allowing users to upload their avatar.

## ðŸ§± Commit Strategy (Migration Process)

We often work in two steps: first UI, then functionality. Here's how to commit:

### 1. Build UI or Scaffold
> `feat` â€” you added a visible structure, even without logic yet.

```bash
feat(home): scaffold layout for homepage
feat(discounts): build static UI for discount cards
```

### 2. Add Logic or API Integration

> `feat` â€” the UI becomes functional.

```bash
feat(discounts): connect discount list to backend
feat(auth): handle login with JWT
```

### 3. Refactor Components or Extract Logic
> `refactor` â€” same behavior, cleaner code.

```bash
refactor(discounts): extract DiscountCard component
```

## 4. Fix a Bug or Edge Case
> `fix` â€” correcting broken behavior.

```bash
fix(profile): fix crash on missing user data
```

### 5. Update Styles, Colors, or Layouts
> `style` â€” purely visual changes.

```bash
style(global): update font sizes and spacing
````


## Rules of Thumb
- Use present tense, imperative voice: add, fix, create, not added or creating

- Should keep the first line under 70 characters

- Use scope (feat(profile):) when possible

- Group related changes into one commit; split unrelated ones
